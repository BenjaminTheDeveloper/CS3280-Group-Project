Air BnB Project

## MVP
- Be able to list/search places (either by file input/output, database, etc.)
  - Show an intro/summary for each Air BnB
  - Show where it is located
  - List of the available amenities, 
  - List of local attractions
  - Special considerations (i.e. handicap accessible)
  - Show your rating
  - Show cost/rates
  - Show availability (black out days its unavailable)
- filter the results or search by a filter (I.e. by 5 star reviews, location, amenities, etc.)
- Enter is reservee's details (I.e. amount of people, name, contacts, special requests, etc.)
- Mimicing a payment screen (Name on card, card number, etc.) for reservation
- Receive confirmation of reservation and payment
